What is _containers_? (take a look at the link:TUTORIAL.adoc[tutorial]!
or the http://cedeela.fr/~simon/software/containers[documentation])
In `containers` and `containers.data`, all modules abide by
_pay for what you use_: only modules that are used are linked (there are no
cross-module dependencies).

- A usable, reasonably well-designed library that extends OCaml's standard
  library (in 'src/core/', packaged under `containers` in ocamlfind. Modules
  are totally independent and are prefixed with `CC` (for "containers-core"
  or "companion-cube" because I'm megalomaniac). This part should be
  usable and should work. For instance, `CCList` contains functions and
  lists including safe versions of `map` and `append`. It also
  provides a drop-in replacement to the standard library, in the module
  `Containers` (intended to be opened, replaces some stdlib modules
  with extended ones).
- Several small additional libraries that complement it:

  containers.data:: with additional data structures that don't have an
    equivalent in the standard library;
  containers.io:: (deprecated)
  containers.iter:: with list-like and tree-like iterators;
  containers.string:: (in directory `string`) with
    a few packed modules that deal with strings (Levenshtein distance,
    KMP search algorithm, and a few naive utils). Again, modules are independent
    and sometimes parametric on the string and char types (so they should
    be able to deal with your favorite unicode library).

- A sub-library with complicated abstractions, `containers.advanced` (with
  a LINQ-like query module, batch operations using GADTs, and others).
- Utilities around the `unix` library in `containers.unix` (mainly to spawn
  sub-processes)
- A bigstring module using `bigarray` in `containers.bigarray` (*deprecated*)
- A lightweight S-expression printer and streaming parser in `containers.sexp`

Some of the modules have been moved to their own repository (e.g. `sequence`,
`gen`, `qcheck`) and are on opam for great fun and profit.

== Use

Start with the link:TUTORIAL.adoc[tutorial]

You can either build and install the library (see <<build>>), or just copy
files to your own project. The last solution has the benefits that you
don't have additional dependencies nor build complications (and it may enable
more inlining). Since modules have a friendly license and are mostly
independent, both options are easy.

In a toplevel, using ocamlfind:

[source,OCaml]
----
# #use "topfind";;
# #require "containers";;
# CCList.flat_map;;
- : ('a -> 'b list) -> 'a list -> 'b list = <fun>
# open Containers;;  (* optional *)
# List.flat_map ;;
- : ('a -> 'b list) -> 'a list -> 'b list = <fun>
----

If you have comments, requests, or bugfixes, please share them! :-)

== Contents

The library contains a <<core,Core part>> that mostly extends the stdlib
and adds a few very common structures (heap, vector), and sub-libraries
that deal with either more specific things, or require additional dependencies.

Some structural types are used throughout the library:

gen:: `'a gen = unit -> 'a option` is an iterator type. Many combinators
  are defined in the opam library https://github.com/c-cube/gen[gen]
sequence:: `'a sequence = (unit -> 'a) -> unit` is also an iterator type.
  It is easier to define on data structures than `gen`, but it a bit less
  powerful.  The opam library https://github.com/c-cube/sequence[sequence]
  can be used to consume and produce values of this type.
error:: `'a or_error = [`Error of string | `Ok of 'a]` is a error type
  that is used in other libraries, too. The reference module in containers
  is `CCError`.
klist:: `'a klist = unit -> [`Nil | `Cons of 'a * 'a klist]` is a lazy list
  without memoization, used as a persistent iterator. The reference
  module is `CCKList` (in `containers.iter`).
printer:: `'a printer = Format.formatter -> 'a -> unit` is a pretty-printer
  to be used with the standard module `Format`. In particular, in many cases,
  `"foo: %a" Foo.print foo` will type-check.

[[core]]

[[build]]
== Build

You will need OCaml `>=` 4.00.0.

=== Via opam

The prefered way to install is through http://opam.ocaml.org/[opam].

    $ opam install containers

=== From Sources

On the branch `master` you will need `oasis` to build the library. On the
branch `stable` it is not necessary.

    $ make

To build and run tests (requires `oUnit` and https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML[qtest]):

    $ opam install oUnit qtest
    $ ./configure --enable-tests --enable-unix --enable-bigarray
    $ make test

To build the small benchmarking suite (requires https://github.com/chris00/ocaml-benchmark[benchmark]):

    $ opam install benchmark
    $ make bench
    $ ./benchs.native

== Contributing

PRs on github are welcome (patches by email too, if you prefer so).

A few guidelines:

- no dependencies between basic modules (even just for signatures);
- add `@since` tags for new functions;
- add tests if possible (using `qtest`).
